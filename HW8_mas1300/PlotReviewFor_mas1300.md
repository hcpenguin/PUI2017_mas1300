Review:


CLARITY: 

The plot is clear, readers wouldn't go wrong about what the author intends to convey is the subway locations information in new york city. The location dots have been plotted on an outline map of all 5 boroughs of New York City, and x and y axises give clear indications of latitude and longitude. The total quantity of all stations doesn't match the '473' in caption though. I assume it is because some subway lines share the same platform or have platforms in multiple ground levels even though at same location.You might want to make a note about this in caption.

ESTHETIC:  

It is very nice that the background is very clear and in 'cool' color so won't distract reader to view the location dots. And all colors are approperiate,people with all 3 main types of color blinds won't have hardtime to read it.
We are missing a legend here since you have dots in different colors. What is the color code here? It doesn't seems to be coded as the line routes. Can this caused by multiple lines share the same location?
From the plot we know Staten Island doesn't have subway, you can point it out in your caption as a find so it makes more sense to include this borough on map. Include it or not really depends on what you want to show, big picture of where the stations are or stations coordinates.
The plot and caption probably can be better arranged, so the plot can be in the middle and caption can be line wrapped to match the width of picture. What do you think? Or is this just because of the cropping from screenshot? 
Another small thing is 'New York City' might be better than 'NYC' in the title, I might be too picky on this one, but if a reader just look at the plot, they might not clear about what 'NYC' stands for.

HONESTY: 

Other than the dots overlayed each other and causes color differences as be stated in first paragraph, the plot honestly reproduces the data and give very clear information of subway stations geo information on map. If you want to show all locations with unique coordinates, this is correct; if you want to show all stations with all lines, you will need to add station quantity information for each unique spot.
